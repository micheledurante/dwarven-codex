## 1. Introduction

Dwarven being a locally spoken dialect of Dwarven, is also an analytic, agglutinative language.

Dwarven is analytic because words don't change their forms, e.g.:

- `deb` means: (to) _eat_ (present or infinite form of the verb)
- `deb` also means: _eats_ (present form conjugation of the verb to the nth person)
- `deb` can also mean: _eaten_ (past perfect of the verb)
- `deb` can also mean: _ate_ (simple past of the verb)

The verb in this case is not conjugated.

Nouns also do not change, e.g.:

- `Mabdug` means _ale_ (singular form)
- `Mabdug` also means _ales_ (plural form)

Additionally, Dwarven nouns are not declined and have no gender, e.g.:

- `Onol` means _mountain_
- `ustos` means _angry_

These words can be combined in `Ustosonol` and this means _angry mountain_.

These words can also be combined as `Onolustus` which means _mountainous anger_.

Words are joined together to form meaning, also known as _affixation_. Therefore the word order is extremely important,
e.g.:

- `Ustosonol` means _angry mountain_
- `Onolustus` means _mountainous anger_

In the examples above, the word at the end is the word being described: it is the noun of the sentence. The other word
when put in front, becomes an adjective.

In this sense, words for verbs, nouns and adjectives are interchangeable: a word can take on any meaning based mostly on
its position in the sentence.

## 2. Divergence from Standard Dwarven

1. In the present tense, the tense marker `udiz` is optional and dropped in the majority of cases.
2. For special Adverbs (_always_, _never_,...), the usage of `-akk` is required.

### 3.1 Word Order

Because Dwarven is an analytic language, one in which words do not change, in order to know the meaning of a word the
context in which the word is used must be considered.

The word order then defines the meaning of a word **in the particular context considered**. The word order in Dwarven
is:

Subject - verb - object - (indirect object) - (anything else)

_SVO_ for short.

### 3.2 Pronouns

Dwarven does not have any pronouns. Personal pronouns like: I, you, we, they. This also applies to their accusative
forms: me, him, her. Dwarven does not have possessive pronouns also: my, our, their do not exist.

In Dwarven everything is in the third person. To indicate the subject speaking (or writing) the word `Kutam` (_speaker_)
can be used:

```
Kutam deb Bemòng
```

```
I eat an apple
```

To indicate instead the person(s) listening, the word `Fmid` (_hearer_) can be used instead:

```
Fmid var Âtast
```

```
You are brave
```

To recap:

- `Kutam` means _speaker_ and can be used as a form of _I_
- `Fmid` means _hearer_ and can be used as a form of _you_, both singular and plural forms

### 3.3 Nouns

Dwarven does not have articles, genders or declinations for nouns.

Nouns in Dwarven are always capitalized:

- `Amal` means _teacher_
- `amal` means (to) _teach_ (also _teaching_)

### 3.4 Adjectives

Words used in front of nouns become adjectives for the noun that follows them, as described in the
[Introduction](#1-Introduction).

More words can be used together to describe other characteristics of the noun via affixation:

- `Ustosonol` means _angry mountain_
- `Orustosonol` means _large angry mountain_

`Orustosonol` is fact composed of the adjectives `or` (_large_), `ustos` (_angry_) and the noun `Onol` (_mountain_). The
first letter must always be capitalized as it indicates a noun.

The order of the adjectives can be used to change the meaning of the resulting word, e.g.:

- `Orustosonol` means _angry large mountain_

Here the speaker wants to stress the "angry" quality of the mountain rather then its size. The first adjective used
describes the most important quality of the noun.

#### 3.4.1 Comparatives And Superlatives

To add a comparison to adjectives (angrier, smaller) Dwarven uses extra adjectives, `morr` (_more_) or `gekur` (_less_):

- `Morrustosonol` means _angrier mountain_
- `Gekurustosonol` means _less angry mountain_

To create superlative adjectives Dwarven uses the adjectives `mos` (_more_) and `gudos` (_less_):

- `Telustosonol` means _angriest mountain_
- `Gudosustosonol` means _least angry mountain_

### 3.5 Verbs

Verbs never change their form (conjugation) in Dwarven and have no tenses. The verb `deb` means (to) _eat_ to indicate
the present, the past or the future. The verb `deb` also does not change for any of the persons as there are no personal
pronouns (I, you, he, she...), whether for the speaker "I" (`Kutam`) or listener (`Fmid`) "you" the verb form is always
`deb`.

In order to indicate the time an action refers to, Dwarven uses **tense markers**. Tense markers are affixed to verbs:
there are 5 tense markers:

- `udiz` is for present (optional)
- `geth` is for past
- `zalud` is for future
- `zott` is for something hypothetical
- `zilir` is imperative

Note that in Dwarven there are no continuos forms of verb tenses (is eating, was eating...).

#### 3.5.1 Present Tense

The word `udiz` is optionally affixed to the verb to indicate the present tense. The un-affixed form of the verb (the
base word) is assumed to be in the present tense when used on its own.

```
Urist deb-udiz Shokmug.
Urist deb Shokmug.
Urist eats cheese.
Urist is eating cheese.
```

#### 3.5.2 Past Tense

The past tense is made by affixing the word `geth` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-geth Shokmug
Urist ate cheese.
Urist was eating cheese.
```

#### 3.5.3 Future Tense

The future tense is made by affixing the word `zalud` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-zalud Shokmug.
Urist eat cheese (later).
Urist will eat cheese.
Urist is going to eat cheese.
```

#### 3.5.4 Hypothetical Tense

The hypothetical tense is made by affixing the word `zott` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-zott Shokmug.
Urist might cheese.
```

#### 3.5.5 Imperative Tense

The imperative tense is made by affixing the word `zilir` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-zilir Shokmug.
Urist eat cheese!
```

#### 3.5.6 Combined Forms

Tense markers can be affixed using the sign `'` in order to create new meaning. Only certain combinations make sense,
but in theory every tense marker can be combined at will and as many as needed. E.g.:

```
Urist deb-zalud'zott Shokmug
Urist might eat cheese (later)
Urist will possibly eat cheese
```

Tense markers can also be combined with any other words to create even further meaning. As mentioned in the
[Introduction](#1-Introduction), words can take on many functions in a sentence based on their position
(Subject-Verb-Object), so it is possible to combine an adjective and a tense marker to create a functioning sentence,
e.g.:

```
Urist ustos(-udiz) Mosus.
Urist angers Mosus.
```

Some combinations are at first glance absurd but are grammatically correct, e.g.:

```
Urist onol(-udiz) Mosus.
Urist mountains (?) Mosus.
```

### 3.6 Adverbs

Adverbs are adjectives that describe verbs. In Dwarven adverbs behave like adjectives: they are not declined therefore
not changing their forms. Adverbs are suffixed to the verb they describe in the same way in which adjectives are to
nouns.

```
Urist buketdeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
Urist quickly eats cheese.
```

The word `bucket` (_quick_, _fast_) can also be used as an adjective for the noun:

```
Urist buketdeb(-udiz) Buketshokmug.
Urist quickly eats fast cheese.
```

#### 3.6.1 Special Adverbs

Words like _always_, _never_, _maybe_, _every_, _finally_... are special adverbs as they cannot just be suffixed to the
verbs: the meaning of "final" is not the same meaning of "finally". For these special adverbs, the ending `-akk` is
affixed to the adjective, e.g.:

- the word `dog` means _there_, so when combined with `-akk` it is used as the adverb _there_

```
Urist dogakkdeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
Urist eats cheese there.
```

In Standard Dwarven the usage of `-akk` is recommended but in Dwarven this is mandatory, e.g.:

```
Urist alodakkdeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
Urist eats cheese daily.
```

This sentence cannot be written in the following form:

```
Urist aloddeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
```

This would create confusion. Fhe word `Alod` (_day_), given its position in the sentence, it is an adverb because it is
found in front of a verb. The suffix `-akk` helps identifying it as such: without it, `Alod` could mean _today_ or
_daily_, which have two completely different meaning.

### 3.7 Passive Voice

The Passive Voice is used when you don't know who the subject is. In MUC Dwarven, the word `ver` (_become_) is used.
`ver` is affixed to the verb and it should be in the first position, in front of adverbs if present. E.g.:

```
Shokmug verdeb-geth.
The cheese was eaten.
```

```
Shokmug verdeb-udiz.
The cheese will be eaten.
```

### 3.8 Possessive Forms

Possessive forms are indicated by affixation to nouns.

```
Shokmug verdeb-geth.
The cheese was eaten.
```
