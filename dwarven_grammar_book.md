## 1 Introduction

Dwarven is an analytic, agglutinative language.

Dwarven is analytic because words don't change their forms:

- `deb` means: (to) _eat_ (present or infinite form of the verb)
- `deb` also means: _eats_ (present form conjugation of the verb to the nth person)
- `deb` can also mean: _eaten_ (past perfect of the verb)
- `deb` can also mean: _ate_ (simple past of the verb)

The verb in this case is not conjugated.

Nouns also do not change:

- `Mabdug` means _ale_ (singular form)
- `Mabdug` also means _ales_ (plural form)

Additionally, Dwarven nouns are not declined and have no gender:

- `Onol` means _mountain_
- `ustos` means _angry_

These words can be combined in `Ustosonol` and this means _angry mountain_.

These words can also be combined as `Onolustus` which means _mountainous anger_.

Words are joined together to form meaning, also known as _affixation_. Therefore the word order is extremely important:

- `Ustosonol` means _angry mountain_
- `Onolustus` means _mountainous anger_

In the examples above, the word at the end is the word being described: it is the noun of the sentence. The other word
when put in front, becomes an adjective.

In this sense, words for verbs, nouns and adjectives are interchangeable: a word can take on any meaning based mostly on
its position in the sentence.

## 2 Divergence from Standard Dwarven

1. In the present tense, the tense marker `udiz` is optional and dropped in the majority of cases.
2. For special Adverbs (_always_, _never_,...), the usage of `-akk` is always required.

## 4 Word Order

Because Dwarven is an analytic language, one in which words do not change, in order to know the meaning of a word the
context in which the word is used must be considered.

The word order then defines the meaning of a word **in the particular context considered**. The word order in Dwarven
is:

Subject - verb - object - (indirect object) - (anything else)

_SVO_ for short.

## 5 Pronouns

Dwarven does not have any pronouns. Personal pronouns like: I, you, we, they. This also applies to their accusative
forms: me, him, her. Dwarven does not have possessive pronouns also: my, our, their do not exist.

In Dwarven everything is in the third person. To indicate the subject speaking (or writing) the word `Kutam` (_speaker_)
can be used:

```
Kutam deb Bemòng.
I eat an apple.
```

To indicate instead the person(s) listening, the word `Fmid` (_hearer_) can be used instead:

```
Fmid var Âtast.
You are brave.
```

To recap:

- `Kutam` means _speaker_ and can be used as a form of _I_
- `Fmid` means _hearer_ and can be used as a form of _you_, both singular and plural forms

## 6 Nouns

Dwarven does not have articles, genders or declinations for nouns.

Nouns in Dwarven are always capitalized:

- `Amal` means _teacher_
- `amal` means (to) _teach_ (also _teaching_)

## 7 Adjectives

Words used in front of nouns become adjectives for the noun that follows them, as described in the
[Introduction](#1introduction).

More words can be used together to describe other characteristics of the noun via affixation:

- `Ustosonol` means _angry mountain_
- `Orustosonol` means _large angry mountain_

`Orustosonol` is fact composed of the adjectives `or` (_large_), `ustos` (_angry_) and the noun `Onol` (_mountain_). The
first letter must always be capitalized as it indicates a noun.

The order of the adjectives can be used to change the meaning of the resulting word:

- `Orustosonol` means _angry large mountain_

Here the speaker wants to stress the "angry" quality of the mountain rather then its size. The first adjective used
describes the most important quality of the noun.

### 7.1 Comparatives And Superlatives

To add a comparison to adjectives (angrier, smaller) Dwarven uses extra adjectives, `morr` (_more_) or `gekur` (_less_):

- `Morrustosonol` means _angrier mountain_
- `Gekurustosonol` means _less angry mountain_

To create superlative adjectives Dwarven uses the adjectives `mos` (_more_) and `gudos` (_less_):

- `Telustosonol` means _angriest mountain_
- `Gudosustosonol` means _least angry mountain_

## 8 Verbs

Verbs never change their form (conjugation) in Dwarven and have no tenses. The verb `deb` means (to) _eat_ to indicate
the present, the past or the future. The verb `deb` also does not change for any of the persons as there are no personal
pronouns (I, you, he, she...), whether for the speaker "I" (`Kutam`) or listener (`Fmid`) "you" the verb form is always
`deb`.

In order to indicate the time an action refers to, Dwarven uses **tense markers**. Tense markers are affixed to verbs:
there are 5 tense markers:

- `udiz` is for present (optional)
- `geth` is for past
- `zalud` is for future
- `zott` is for something hypothetical
- `zilir` is imperative

Note that in Dwarven there are no continuous forms of verb tenses (is eating, was eating...).

### 8.1 Present Tense

The word `udiz` is optionally affixed to the verb to indicate the present tense. The un-affixed form of the verb (the
base word) is assumed to be in the present tense when used on its own.

```
Urist deb-udiz Shokmug.
Urist deb Shokmug.
Urist eats cheese.
Urist is eating cheese.
```

### 8.2 Past Tense

The past tense is made by affixing the word `geth` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-geth Shokmug
Urist ate cheese.
Urist was eating cheese.
```

### 8.3 Future Tense

The future tense is made by affixing the word `zalud` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-zalud Shokmug.
Urist eat cheese (later).
Urist will eat cheese.
Urist is going to eat cheese.
```

### 8.4 Hypothetical Tense

The hypothetical tense is made by affixing the word `zott` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-zott Shokmug.
Urist might cheese.
```

### 8.5 Imperative Tense

The imperative tense is made by affixing the word `zilir` to the verb.

```
Urist deb-zilir Shokmug.
Urist eat cheese!
```

### 8.6 Combined Forms

Tense markers can be affixed using the sign `'` in order to create new meaning. Only certain combinations make sense,
but in theory every tense marker can be combined at will and as many as needed:

```
Urist deb-zalud'zott Shokmug
Urist might eat cheese (later)
Urist will possibly eat cheese
```

Tense markers can also be combined with any other words to create even further meaning. As mentioned in the
[Introduction](#1introduction), words can take on many functions in a sentence based on their position
(Subject-Verb-Object), so it is possible to combine an adjective and a tense marker to create a functioning sentence:

```
Urist ustos(-udiz) Mosus.
Urist angers Mosus.
```

Some combinations are at first glance absurd but are grammatically correct:

```
Urist onol(-udiz) Mosus.
Urist mountains (?) Mosus.
```

## 9 Adverbs

Adverbs are adjectives that describe verbs. In Dwarven adverbs behave like adjectives: they are not declined therefore
not changing their forms. Adverbs are suffixed to the verb they describe in the same way in which adjectives are to
nouns.

```
Urist buketdeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
Urist quickly eats cheese.
```

The word `bucket` (_quick_, _fast_) can also be used as an adjective for the noun:

```
Urist buketdeb(-udiz) Buketshokmug.
Urist quickly eats fast cheese.
```

### 9.1 Special Adverbs

Words like _always_, _never_, _maybe_, _every_, _finally_... are special adverbs as they cannot just be suffixed to the
verbs: the meaning of "final" is not the same meaning of "finally". For these special adverbs, the ending `-akk` is
affixed to the adjective:

- the word `dog` means _there_, so when combined with `-akk` it is used as the adverb _there_

```
Urist dogakkdeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
Urist eats cheese there.
```

In Standard Dwarven the usage of `-akk` is recommended but in Dwarven this is mandatory:

```
Urist alodakkdeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
Urist eats cheese daily.
```

This sentence cannot be written in the following form:

```
Urist aloddeb(-udiz) Shokmug.
```

This would create confusion. Fhe word `Alod` (_day_), given its position in the sentence, it is an adverb because it is
found in front of a verb. The suffix `-akk` helps identifying it as such: without it, `Alod` could mean _today_ or
_daily_, which have two completely different meaning.

## 10 Passive Voice

The Passive Voice is used when you don't know who the subject is and the object of the sentence becomes the focus. In
Dwarven, the word `ver` (_become_) is used. `ver` is affixed to the verb and it should be in the first position, in
front of adverbs if present:

```
Shokmug verdeb-geth.
The cheese was eaten.
```

```
Shokmug verdeb-udiz.
The cheese will be eaten.
```

## 11 Possessive Forms

Dwarven has no prepositions and no pronouns: the possessive forms are indicated by affixation of the word `-long` (_to
belong to_, _belonging to_) to nouns, followed by another noun to indicate possession:

```
Shokmug-longUrist.
Urist´s cheese.
The cheese (that) belongs to Urist.
The cheese belonging to Urist.
```

```
Urist deb-geth Shokmug-longMosus.
Urist ate Mosus´s cheese.
(Urist eat-past cheese-belongstoMosus)
```

## 12 Question Words

Question words end in `-arg`. The following is the list of question words in Dwarven:

- `vadarg` means _what_
- `vasarg` means _where_
- `udosarg` means _who_
- `-longudosarg` means _whose_ (belonging to who)
- `vanarg` means _when_
- `hivarg` means _why_
- `nigarg` means _how_
- `vilkarg` means _which_

Questions words go at the end of a sentence, as the SVO structure of Dwarven sentences does not allow other words to be
at the beginning or in the middle.

```
Urist var-udiz varsag.
Where is Urist? (Urist to be-present where)
```

```
Avuziseth-longudosarg.
Whose job is it to mine? (mining task-belongs to who)
```

```
Shámmankutam var-udiz vasarg.
Where are we? (many speaker to be-present where)
```

## 13 Numbers

Number until 10 can be found in the first section of the table below. Numbers higher than 10 are formed by a combination
of sums and multiplications. The connector between numbers `-` indicates a sum, while `i` indicates a multiplication:

- 10 `zez`
- 11 `zez-nir` (10 + 1)
- 20 `nobizez` (2 * 10)
- 21 `nobizez-nir` (2 * 10 + 1)

Numbers until 50 are shown here:

|     |      |     |          |     |              |     |              |     |              |
|----:|------|----:|----------|----:|--------------|----:|--------------|----:|--------------|
|   1 | nir  |  11 | zez-nir  |  21 | nobizez-nir  |  31 | mezizez-nir  |  41 | vorizez-nir  |
|   2 | nob  |  12 | zez-nob  |  22 | nobizez-nob  |  32 | mezizez-nob  |  42 | vorizez-nob  |
|   3 | mez  |  13 | zez-mez  |  23 | nobizez-mez  |  33 | mezizez-mez  |  43 | vorizez-mez  |
|   4 | vor  |  14 | zez-vor  |  24 | nobizez-vor  |  34 | mezizez-vor  |  44 | vorizez-vor  |
|   5 | fimm |  15 | zez-fimm |  25 | nobizez-fimm |  35 | mezizez-fimm |  45 | vorizez-fimm |
|   6 | gät  |  16 | zez-gät  |  26 | nobizez-gät  |  36 | mezizez-gät  |  46 | vorizez-gät  |
|   7 | sjun |  17 | zez-sjun |  27 | nobizez-sjun |  37 | mezizez-sjun |  47 | vorizez-sjun |
|   8 | ått  |  18 | zez-ått  |  28 | nobizez-ått  |  38 | mezizez-ått  |  48 | vorizez-ått  |
|   9 | nag  |  19 | zez-nag  |  29 | nobizez-nag  |  39 | mezizez-nag  |  49 | vorizez-nag  |
|  10 | zez  |  20 | nobizez  |  30 | mezizez      |  40 | vorizez      |  50 | fimmizez     |

Multiples of 10s have special words:

- 100 `zezbog`
- 1000 `zezton`
- 10e4 `zezgurn`
- 10e5 `zezmal`
- 10e6 `zeztük`

More complex examples are shown here:

- 257 `nobizezbog-fimmzez-sjun` ((2 * 100) + (5 * 10) + 7)
- 1739 `zezton-sjunizezbog-mezizez-nag` ((1 * 1000) + (7 * 100) + (3 * 10) + 9)

### 13.1 Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers are formed from cardinal numbers by appending a `-t`:

- `nirt` means _first_
- `nobt` means _second_
- `mezt` means _third_

```
Urist sogg-udiz Nironol.
Urist sees one mountain. (Urist to see-present one mountain)
```

```
Urist sogg-udiz Nirtonol.
Urist sees the first mountain. (Urist to see-present first mountain)
```
