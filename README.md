# Dwarven Codex

Written in vanilla JS with ES5 imports, web components and ES2015 features.

To compile the application, Deno and TS are used.

## Compile

Before running the application, language files and other steps must be performed with:

`deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-sys .\bin\compile.ts`

Now you can run `web/index.html` with a modern browser: there is no support for anything older than ES2015.
